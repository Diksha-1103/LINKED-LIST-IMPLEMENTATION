**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**

A singly linked list is the most simple type of linked list, with each node containing some data as well as a pointer to the next node. That is a singly linked list allows traversal of data only in one way.
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:
   >Data (the actual value)
   >A pointer to the next node in the list
   >The list ends with a node that has its next pointer set to NULL.

There are several linked list operations that allow us to perform different tasks & the basic linked list operations are:

  >Traversal – Access the nodes of the list
  >Insertion – Adds a new node to an existing linked list
  >Deletion – Removes a node from an existing linked list
  >Search – Finds a particular element in the linked list
