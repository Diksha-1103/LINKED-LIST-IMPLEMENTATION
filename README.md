**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**

A singly linked list is the most simple type of linked list, with each node containing some data as well as a pointer to the next node. That is a singly linked list allows traversal of data only in one way.
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:
   (a) Data (the actual value)
   (b) A pointer to the next node in the list
   (c) The list ends with a node that has its next pointer set to NULL.

There are several linked list operations that allow us to perform different tasks & the basic linked list operations are:

  (1) Traversal – Access the nodes of the list
  (2) Insertion – Adds a new node to an existing linked list
  (3) Deletion – Removes a node from an existing linked list
  (4) Search – Finds a particular element in the linked list
